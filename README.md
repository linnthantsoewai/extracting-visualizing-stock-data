## ðŸ“ˆ Overview

This project demonstrates how to extract and visualize stock and revenue data for publicly traded companies using Python. Specifically, it focuses on Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME), showcasing how to retrieve historical stock prices using the `yfinance` library and quarterly revenue data through web scraping with `BeautifulSoup`.

The analysis culminates in interactive visualizations created with `plotly`, enabling users to explore trends in share price and revenue side by side. This approach provides insights into the relationship between market performance and financial growth over time, and highlights the power of combining financial APIs, web data extraction, and modern visualization tools in a data science workflow.
